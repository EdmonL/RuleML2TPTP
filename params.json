{"name":"RuleML2TPTP","tagline":"This project is aimed at implementing an XSLT 2.0 translator to convert Datalog+ Deliberation RuleML 1.01 in XML format to an equivalent representation in a subset of the TPTP (Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers) format.","body":"RuleML2TPTP\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\n[RuleML](http://wiki.ruleml.org) is a knowledge representation language developed by a non-profit organization RuleML Inc. RuleML is being used for sharing rule bases in XML and publishing them on the Web. It has broad coverage and is defined as an extensible family of sublanguages across various rule logics and platforms. RuleML consists of [Deliberation RuleML](http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Specification_of_Deliberation_RuleML) and [Reaction RuleML](http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Specification_of_Reaction_RuleML). \r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at implementing an [XSLT 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/) translator to convert [Datalog+](http://www.slideshare.net/polibear/datalog-and-its-extensions-for-semantic-web-databases) [Deliberation RuleML 1.01](http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Specification_of_Deliberation_RuleML_1.01) in XML format to an equivalent representation in a subset of the (FOF) [TPTP](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/) language. See [here](http://deliberation.ruleml.org/1.01/doc/datalogplus_min_normal/) for the normalized Datalog+ Deliberation RuleML 1.01 schema on which this project is based.\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\n\r\n1. Download the binary or source code from the [project releases](https://github.com/EdmonL/RuleML2TPTP/releases).\r\n2. If source code is downloaded, use ant to build by \"ant jar\" or \"ant release\". See \"ant -projecthelp\" for other ant targets.\r\n3. Execute by calling \"java -jar /path/to/ruleml2tptp.jar -s &lt;source RuleML file&gt; -o &lt;output filename&gt;\". See \"java -jar /path/to/ruleml2tptp.jar -h\" for full usage.\r\n4. Java SE 7 or higher is recommended.\r\n5. Saxon is used but dynamically, so saxon.jar can be removed and the local JAXP implementation will be used. Make sure, however, that the local implementation supports XSLT 2.0, or things will go wrong.\r\n6. See the [project wiki](https://github.com/EdmonL/RuleML2TPTP/wiki) for the other documentation.\r\n\r\n### RuleML examples\r\nGet RuleML examples from [RuleML wiki](http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Specification_of_Deliberation_RuleML_1.01#Examples) or [here](http://deliberation.ruleml.org/1.01/exa/DatalogPlus/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
