=============================

#### Introduction

[RuleML](http://wiki.ruleml.org) is a knowledge representation language developed by a non-profit organization RuleML Inc. RuleML is being used for sharing rule bases in XML and publishing them on the Web. It has broad coverage and is defined as an extensible family of sublanguages across various rule logics and platforms. RuleML consists of [Deliberation RuleML](http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Specification_of_Deliberation_RuleML) and [Reaction RuleML](http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Specification_of_Reaction_RuleML). 

This project is aimed at implementing an XSLT 2.0 translator to convert [Datalog+](http://www.slideshare.net/polibear/datalog-and-its-extensions-for-semantic-web-databases) [Deliberation RuleML 1.01](http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Specification_of_Deliberation_RuleML_1.01) in XML format to an equivalent representation in a subset of the [TPTP](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/) language.
